According to Merriam-Webster one definition of [oblivion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oblivion){:target="_blank"} is

>the state of being unconscious or unaware : the state of not knowing what is going on around you.

Until a few days ago, I've only ever thought of oblivion as the state of something being destroyed. Which it is of course, that's another one of the Merriam-Webster definitions! And then I made plans to go for a walk with someone that I'm just getting to know. And things changed. See I have this tendancy to over-think. A lot of us have such a tendancy, so maybe you can relate. And I started thinking about all the questions I should have in reserve to ask, ya know, in the case that things get *too* silent. Maybe you can imagine. I was going through these questions in my head and I got stuck on the ol' "what's your biggest fear?" Because of course, if you're going to ask a question like that you should be prepared to answer it too, right? And I got to thinking, and realized that I am terrified of... you guessed it! Oblivion.

>the state of being unconscious or unaware : the state of not knowing what is going on around you.

It was crazy! I didn't even have to search around for the right word. When I searched for the definition, it just fit what I felt. Allow me to expand since unless your name is Sarah Klager, you probably don't know what's going on in my head. I'm afraid of missing details, important events, things that someone you're on a walk with says that seem important to her and you really don't want to miss them because you want to know about her because she is cool and interesting and complex and beautiful and only slightly less-beautiful than Brad Pitt because let's face it who can compare to Brad?! Why would I miss these things? Lots of reasons probably. But mostly because I'm too busy thinking about me, Sam, the idiot in 'idiot!' 

>the state of being unconscious or unaware : the state of not knowing what is going on around you.

I hate myself. And I know what you're thinking "Sam, you can't hate yourself, you have to love yourself! Because if you can't love yourself how can you love anyone else?" Well I'll tell you how! I hate having to live by an image, to portray myself to other people as someone who knows things, has opinions, likes to generalize things into little quotes we can repeat to ourselves to feel better in the misery of existence. No I don't want to be myself. I just want to exist, without having to be. I want to do. I want to listen. I want to learn. I want to know other people for more than what they are to the world because other people are so much more interesting than me. God I hope this doesn't sound nuts to you, because it really doesn't sound that nuts to me.

>the state of being unconscious or unaware : the state of not knowing what is going on around you.

So yes, I am afraid of oblivion. I am afraid of losing my mind in myself. I'm afraid of fucking it all up because I'm just a little lost.

Anyway, I have school in a few hours and I should try to sleep. Talk to you later.
