Dear Sam,

Romanticism (a.k.a capitalism) teaches us that there are answers to such questions as: What is the meaning of life? What will make me happy and satisfied? etc. But there aren't answers to these questions.

There just aren't. So don't waste your time trying to find answer that don't exist, 'kay? There are plently of answer that do exist that are worth finding.

Sincerely,
Sam
