*idiot!* is a blog about life. Or one life. The life of an idiot; and all of the idiotic things rushing through and about their brain on a daily basis.

>"Wait so... are you the idiot in 'idiot!'?"

That's the idea. We can think about my knowledge as a proportion, with an instantaneous constant of knowledge $c$ in the numerator, and all obtainable knowledge $x$ in the denomintor.

$$
\begin{align}

\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{c}{x}=0 \label{eq:t1}

\end{align}
$$

There are always more things to know, so of course $x$ grows very large, hence the limit. One could make a similar argument in the ratio of $c$ to some function of itself, e.g.

$$
\begin{align}

\frac{c}{c!+\dots}

\end{align}
$$

As the relationship between current knowledge and all knowledge is probably direct, but we won't worry too much about such things. 

>"So in comparison to what you do know, what you don't know is of such magnitude that proportionally you know nothing and therefore are an idiot?"

Precisely. I suppose we could consider the reciprocal of $\eqref{eq:t1}$, then it wouldn't really be a proportion anymore and I would just be divergently stupid. Which I guess is true anyway.

>"By that logic, wouldn't everyone be an idiot?"

Clearly it's not my place to call **everyone** in the world an idiot, even if it's true.

>"Wait a minute... are you just looking for justification to do stupid things?"

Sort of -- well yes -- but also not really -- and no. Depends on the thing I guess. Knowledge is funny. If we think we already know something, then we're probably further away from actually knowing it then we would be if we maintained an outlook of perpetual ignorance. Recognition of our own stupidity is a necessary initial condition for any sort of meaningful learning. After that self-belief is what matters. Perhaps it's important to differentiate between being stupid in order to learn, and taking stupid actions; in fact maybe the former prevents the latter. 

>"Ever wonder if maybe you think too much?"

All the time. As this blog grows, it'll probably just become a catalog of all the things I've overthought; and maybe some math.
