*idiot!* is a blog about life. Or one life. The life of an idiot; and all of the idiotic things rushing through and about their brain on a daily basis.

>"Wait so... are you the idiot in 'idiot!'?"

That's the idea. We can think about my knowledge as a proportion, with an instantaneous constant of knowledge $c$ in the numerator, and all obtainable knowledge $x$ in the denominator, i.e.

$$
\begin{align}

\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{c}{x}=0 \label{eq:t1}

\end{align}
$$

There are always more things to know, so of course $x$ grows very large, hence the limit. One could make a similar argument in the ratio of $c$ to some function of itself, e.g.

$$
\begin{align}

\frac{c}{c!+\dots} \label{eq:t2}

\end{align}
$$

As the relationship between current knowledge and all knowledge is probably direct, but we won't worry too much about such things. 

>"So in comparison to what you do know, what you don't know is of such magnitude that proportionally you know nothing and therefore are an idiot?"

Precisely. I suppose we could consider the reciprocal of $\eqref{eq:t1}$, then it wouldn't really be a proportion anymore and I would just be divergently stupid. Which I guess is true anyway.

>"By that logic, wouldn't everyone be an idiot?"

Clearly it's not my place to call **everyone** in the world an idiot, even if it's true.

>"Wait a minute... are you just looking for justification to do stupid things?"

Sort of -- well yes -- but also not really -- and no. Depends on the thing I guess. Knowledge is funny. If we think we already know something, then we're probably further away from actually knowing it then we would be if we maintained an outlook of perpetual ignorance. Recognition of our own stupidity is a necessary initial condition for any sort of meaningful learning. After that self-belief is what matters. Perhaps it's important to differentiate between being stupid in order to learn, and taking stupid actions; in fact maybe the former prevents the latter. 

>"Ever wonder if maybe you think too much?"

All the time. As this blog grows, it'll probably just become a catalog of all the things I've overthought.

>"Can you talk more about the second expression above? I'm sure other exceedingly-normal-people like me, the voice in your head, would really like that."

Absolutely. It's difficult to approximate the true growth in things that there are to know everytime we learn something new. It's even difficult to define exactly what we are counting. Intuitively it just seems to me like this effect should be present. Of course, how the effect is present for every different kind of knowledge makes modelling extremely difficult. In $\eqref{eq:t2}$ I say that perhaps for an increase in $c$ there is an increase of $c!$ in what would be $x$. I also made the denominator term additive since an increase of $c!$ may not be the only effect. I'll leave it up to you to speculate what other sort of ratios may be plausible, but really the point of stating the above expressions is not to be mathematically accurate; the idea is more of a thought experiment.
