*idiot!* is a blog about life. Or one life. The life of an idiot; and all of the idiotic things they think about on a daily basis.

>"So... you're the idiot in 'idiot!'?"

That's the idea. We can think about individual knowledge as a proportion, with instantaneous constant of knowledge $c$ in the numerator, and all obtainable knowledge $x$ in the denomintor.

$$
\begin{align}

\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{c}{x}=0 \label{eq:t1}

\end{align}
$$

There are always more things to know, so of course $x$ grows very large, hence the limit. One could probably make a similar argument in the ratio of $c$ to some function of itself, e.g.

$$
\begin{align}

\frac{c}{c!+\dots}

\end{align}
$$

As the relationship between current knowledge and all knowledge is probably direct, but we won't worry too much about such things. 

>"So in comparison to what you do know, what you don't know is of such magnitude that proportionally you know nothing and therefore are an idiot?"

Precisely. I suppose we could take the reciprocal of $\eqref{eq:t1}$, then it wouldn't really be a proportion anymore, I would just be divergently stupid. 

>"Wait a minute... are you just looking for justification to do and say stupid things?"

Sort of -- well yes -- but actually not really. Knowledge is a funny thing. Belief.
